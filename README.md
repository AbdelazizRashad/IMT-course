# IMT-course
Personal repository of all C activities I did during embedded software course in IMT School.

This lib directory contains drivers for various compnents inside the AVR ATmega32, like timers, interrupts, ADC, and DIO. Also, in this directory you will fine a Makfile that is used to build code into executables that run on the MCU.
